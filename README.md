# Horus

I make no claims (or apologies) about the quality of code here, this was something I did over Christmas entirely for fun. I started out on my own, then realised the topic was more complex than I gave it credit for, and so started using Peter Shirley's 'Ray Tracing in One Weekend' for reference when I got stuck. Needless to say it took me a lot longer than one weekend.

This is in C rather than C++, there's no instrinsics or AABB's so rendering is absurdly slow - I did add some code for a basic window, some simple multi-threading, output logging and and the usual viridis function and supporting data for pallete. It's called Horus cos that's what my 'pretentious-Visual-Studio-project-name-generator' decided to call it.
