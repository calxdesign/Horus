This was something I did over Christmas entirely for fun, learning. I started out on my own, then realised the topic was more complex than I gave it credit for, and so started using Peter Shirley's '[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html)' for reference when I got stuck. Needless to say it took me a lot longer than one weekend.

This is in C (not C++) there's no intrinsics or AABB's so rendering is absurdly slow - I did add some code for a basic window, some simple multi-threading, output logging and and the usual viridis function and supporting data for palette. 

It's called Horus cos that's what my *Pretentious-Visual-Studio-Project-Name-Generator'* decided to call it.

I make no claims (or apologies) about the quality of code here - [give me a shout if you have any questions](https://twitter.com/_calx).
